# Configuration

git-mkver comes with a default configuration. It can be overridden by creating a custom config file.

git-mkver will search for config in this order:

- file specified by the `-c` or `--configFile` command line argument
- file specified by the `GITMKVER_CONFIG` environment variable
- `mkver.conf` in the current working directory
  
The application uses the HOCON format. More details on the specification can be found
[here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

Environment variables can be resolved in the config using the syntax `${?ENV_VAR_NAME}`.

## mkver.conf

  tagMessageFormat: "release {Tag}"
  # format tring for the pre-release. The format must end with {PreReleaseNumber} if it is used.
  # Examples:
  # * alpha
  # * SNAPSHOT
  # * RC{PreReleaseNumber}
  # * pre-{CommitsSinceTag}
  preReleaseFormat: "RC{PreReleaseNumber}"
  # format string to be used for the build metadata

  # action to take, if after analyzing all commit messages since the last tag
  # no increment instructions can be found. Options are:
